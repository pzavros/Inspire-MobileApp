# Week 1 (27 Jan-3 Feb):
> Introduced to the company, met with the client, and held a discussion about the application (functionalities and requirements) after that decided with teammates the roles and the plan to follow as well as the things needed to be done until the next meeting. Created a wireframe for the application.

# Week 2 (3 Feb-10 Feb):
> Held discussions around the wireframe, and was assigned to implement the application's home page as described in the wireframe. Improved the wireframe and successfully developed the home page with no functionality.

# Week 3 (10 Feb-17 Feb):
> In the meeting, we discussed about the application, specifically on how the data will be stored and retrieved using firebase. But for this sprint, we decided that we will implement all the pages according to the wireframe v1.1, that's simply just views with no functionalities and I was assigned to implement admin, create, and modify pages. Successfully implemented admin and create page with simple UI and added navigation around Home -> Admin -> Create.

# Week 4 (17 Feb-24 Feb):
> Presented the application prototype to the client and was able to meet his expectation, furthermore the next step is to implement simple interactions with the backend which my role is to develop data storage that allows the creation of competition names stored in the database and present them in the home and create pages. Implemented a backend that allows the admin to insert the name of the competition into the firebase realtime database with some validation such as name cannot be empty while inserting, in addition the appropriate popup message will show up if the action was successful or failed.

# Week 5 (24 Feb-3 Mar):
> No meeting for this week, did a investigation and readings on how to implement an adding question functionality and how the data should be structured in the firebase database,and which way it's easier to retrieve it afterwards. With top priority that it must be functional.

# Week 6 (3 Mar-10 Mar):
> Further developed the app requirements, improved backend database structure and fixed some issues. Initialized the functionality to add questions but need improvements.

# Week 7 (10 Mar-17 Mar):
> As the previous implementation of question functionality did not worked as indented especially had issues and difficulties on how to handle the data. Therefor, question functionality has been redesigned and made improvements with the main focus on adding and fetching the data. Furthermore, had considerations on how to modify the questions, that is when changing an existing question which shouldn't be an issue but when it comes to deletion, it encoders few problems.

# Week 7 (17 Mar-24 Mar):
> Created a modify view for questions that allows the admin to update or delete an existing question, the functionality of removing the competition has been added and overall improved UI design.
