# Week 1 (27 Jan-3 Feb):

> Introduced to the company, met with the client, and held a discussion about the application (functionalities and requirements) after that decided with teammates the roles and the plan to follow as well as the things needed to be done until the next meeting. Created a wireframe for the application.

# Week 2 (3 Feb-10 Feb):
> Held discussions around the wireframe, and was assigned to implement the application's home page as described in the wireframe. Improved the wireframe and successfully developed the home page with no functionality.

# Week 3 (10 Feb-17 Feb):
> In the meeting, we discussed about the application, specifically on how the data will be stored and retrieved using firebase. But for this sprint, we decided that we will implement all the pages according to the wireframe v1.1, that's simply just views with no functionalities and I was assigned to implement admin, create, and modify pages. Successfully implemented admin and create page with simple UI and added navigation around Home -> Admin -> Create.
